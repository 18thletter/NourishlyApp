# Nourishly

Nourishly is an app to use when you've come across a conflict situation
and pause before reacting. This pause is the important step allowing you to
_respond_ to a situation instead of _reacting_ to it.

The app helps you journal your challenging experiences and puts them together
in a convenient place.

## RAIN
The underlying concept is identified by the acronym RAIN:
- Recognize
- Allow
- Investigate
- Nourish

### Recognize and Allow
Recognizing and Allowing go hand in hand. This is the first step to the pause
in a conflict situation. These steps allow you to take a look at what is
happening in the moment of a conflict. It is important to do this in a gentle,
non-judgmental manner.

### Investigate
Investigating is deepening the inspection, asking the question "What is really
happening right now?" This investigation delves into the body and mind. It
is important in this step not to psychoanalyze or look for solutions, nor
is it a time to look at how the situation could have gone differently. It is
simply going under layer by layer into the suffering that is happening at the
moment.

### Nourish
The last step, Nourish, is vital. In fact, it is recommended to Nourish even
if you haven't fully recognized or investigated. This step is to even further
deepen the investigating, asking the question "What do I need at this moment?"

## Further Info
The RAIN concept is borrowed from Tara Brach. [This video]

introduction to the concept.
